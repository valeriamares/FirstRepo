  <p style="color : blue">Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) is a former White House Communications Director for the President of the United States who has left to run her own crisis management firm, Olivia Pope & Associates, dedicating her life to protecting the public images of the nation's elite, but struggles with leaving her past relationship with the President, Fitzgerald Grant III (Tony Goldwyn) behind, which leads to a complicated relationship with the First Lady, Mellie Grant (Bellamy Young). Further complication ensues when former Navy Seal and coworker to the president Jake Ballard (Scott Foley) begins a relationship with Olivia. Olivia and her team of "gladiators", including former CIA operative Huck Finn (Guillermo Diaz), professional hacker Quinn Perkins (Katie Lowes), identity politics expert Marcus Walker (Cornelius Smith Jr.), Press Liaison to the White House, Abby Whelan (Darby Stanchfield), Attorney General of the United States, David Rosen (Josh Malina), and White House Chief of Staff, Cyrus Beene (Jeff Perry), all work to ensure President Grant remains in power, and give the Grant Administration an admirable legacy against the attacks of a vindictive and ambitious Mellie Grant and the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, Elizabeth North (Portia de Rossi). Former OPA workers include former Wall Street banker Harrison Wright (Columbus Short) and current Russian oligarchy operative Steven Finch (Henry Ian Cusick).</p>
